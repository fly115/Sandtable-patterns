# Sandtable-patterns
collection of sandtable (sysiphus style) patterns in gcode format.
These are all currently adjusted for a 500x500mm sand drawing area. Upload to sandify.org to make them suit your sandtable dimensions. Should also work with sysiphus tables if you export as .THR
I run these on octoprint using the playlist plugin (https://github.com/jneilliii/OctoPrint-Playlist)
I also suggest using the Mutiple Upload plugin (https://plugins.octoprint.org/plugins/MultipleUpload/) to allow you to upload patterns to octoprint in a batch. 

These are patterns that I have created or collected from various places over time. Most of them are not my original patterns but they are all publicly available.

The patterns are currently numbered in an order that I think works well on a playlist. This numbering system helps when adding them to the playlist.
The naming convention is as follows:
(E) indicates if the pattern is an 'Eraser' pattern - which means it either has an eraser built in or the pattern itself is dense enough to completely write over any previous pattern. If it does not have (E) in the name it likely needs a seperate erraser pattern before it. 
(C C) or other combination of N, S, W, E, C coordinates indicate (Start position, End position) in compase coordinates where C indicates 'Centre'. 
(BJ) indicates one of my original patterns.
